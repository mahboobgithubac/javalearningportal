  <h2>Garbage Collection in Java</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Garbage Collection (GC)</strong> in Java is the process of automatically identifying and reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer reachable or needed by the application.
    This helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes resource usage without requiring manual memory management like in C or C++.
  </p>
  <p>
    Java's garbage collector runs in the background and tracks object references. When an object becomes unreachable (i.e., no references point to it), it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
    Java provides several garbage collectors like Serial GC, Parallel GC, CMS, and G1, which you can select based on your application's needs.
  </p>

  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <pre><code>public class GarbageCollectionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Object created and becomes eligible for GC after losing reference
        GarbageCollectionExample obj1 = new GarbageCollectionExample();
        GarbageCollectionExample obj2 = new GarbageCollectionExample();

        obj1 = null; // obj1 is now eligible for GC
        obj2 = null; // obj2 is now eligible for GC

        // Suggest JVM to run garbage collector
        System.gc(); // JVM may or may not run GC immediately
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Garbage collector called on object");
    }
}
  </code></pre>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>finalize()</code> method is called by the GC before reclaiming memory, but it is deprecated in Java 9 and later versions.</p>
